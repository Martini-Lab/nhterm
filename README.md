A modern-designed android terminal emulator for the 21st century.

### Our Pledge

Originally, NeoTerm was designed as the front end of Termux to provide some functions that Termux didn't have, but we
found it very convenient. In continuous development, we discovered our goal: to be the best terminal for Android.
